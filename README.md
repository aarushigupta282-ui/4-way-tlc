# 4-way-tlc
This project implements a 4-way traffic light controller using Verilog HDL and takes it through the complete ASIC design flow, from RTL coding to physical design. The controller manages signal sequencing (Red, Yellow, Green) for four directions, ensuring safe and efficient traffic management at an intersection.
