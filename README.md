# 4-Way Traffic Light Controller (ASIC Flow)

This project implements a **4-way traffic light controller** using Verilog HDL and takes it through the **complete ASIC design flow**, from RTL coding to physical design. The controller manages signal sequencing (Red, Yellow, Green) for four directions, ensuring safe and efficient traffic management at an intersection.  

---

## Key Highlights  
- Designed **RTL code** for a 4-way traffic light controller in Verilog.  
- Verified functionality using a **testbench and simulation tools**.  
- Performed **synthesis** to generate gate-level netlist.  
- Applied **floorplanning, placement, and routing** for physical design.  
- Conducted **power analysis and DRC/LVS checks**.  
- Generated **GDSII file**, completing the ASIC flow.
